father	Monica	So what! As long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil I don't care.	858
father	Mona	Okay.	1529
father	Phoebe	Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him.	1530
father	Phoebe	Go!	1531
father	Rachel	What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?	1532

parents	Monica	Hey!	3496
parents	Cliff	No.	4102
parents	Ross	Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?	4103

parents	Joey and Ross	Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle.	6629
parents	Monica	I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.	6630
parents	Phoebe	Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!	6631
parents	Paul	I wanted a big wheel.	6665
parents	Paul	And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on.	6666
parents	Paul	It was embarrassing, kids made fun of me.	6667
parents	Chip	Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.	7206

parents	Phoebe	Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me!	7471
parents	Chandler	See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.	7472
parents	Ross	Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?	7473
parents	Rachel	His new girlfriend!	8421
parents	Monica	I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?	8422
parents	Chandler	I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.	8423
parents	Rachel	Well what happened at dinner?	8426
parents	Monica	My parents spent the money for our wedding!	8427
parents	Phoebe	My God! What did you order?!	8428
parents	Joey	I knew I shouldn't have mentioned it! That's what I wanted to name my kid!	8730
parents	Mrs. Geller	What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.	8731
parents	Mr. Geller	I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!	8732
parents	Ross	Thank God.	9764
parents	Cassie	I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.	9765
parents	Ross	Oh right.	9766
parents	Ross	Postpone it?	9992
parents	Ross	Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding?	9993
parents	Ross	Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh?	9994
parents	Joey	Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?	10349
parents	Ross	Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.	10350
parents	Monica	You are so cute! How did you get to be so cute?	10351
