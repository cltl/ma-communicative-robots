And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."

,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,1803 Mrs. Geller  Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
,,,,,,,1804 Monica  ...I can imagine.
,,,,,,,"1805 Mrs. Geller  I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is."
,,,,,,,"1806 Monica  That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
,,,,,,,1807 Mrs. Geller  Tell her what?
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"1831 Rachel  Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
,,,,,,,1832 Terry  An advance?
,,,,,,,"1833 Rachel  It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
,,,,,,,"1834 Terry  Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
,,,,,,,"1835 Rachel  Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"1914 Chandler  All right, I'm nine years old."
,,,,,,,"1915 Ross  Oh, I hate this story."
,,,,,,,"1916 Chandler  We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
,,,,,,,1917 Rachel  Oh my god.
,,,,,,,1918 Chandler  Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"1953 Joey  Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
,,,,,,,1954 Monica  That's not a question.
,,,,,,,"1955 Joey  But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
,,,,,,,"1956 Monica  All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
,,,,,,,"1957 Ross  Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"1962 Phoebe  Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
,,,,,,,1963 Monica  Why would we do that?
,,,,,,,"1964 Phoebe  Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died."
,,,,,,,"1965 Monica  Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
,,,,,,,"1966 Rachel  Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2006 Ross  Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
,,,,,,,2007 Susan  I felt it!
,,,,,,,"2008 Ross  Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
,,,,,,,"2009 Joey  Nope, not that one."
,,,,,,,2010 Monica  Can you go any faster with that?
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2069 Monica  Why don't you just get a roommate?
,,,,,,,"2070 Ross  Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
,,,,,,,"2071 Phoebe  So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman."
,,,,,,,2072 Chandler  Might wanna open with the snowman.
,,,,,,,"2073 All  Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2277 Rachel  I can't kiss anyone.
,,,,,,,2278 Monica  So I'm kissing everyone?
,,,,,,,"2279 Joey  Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
,,,,,,,2280 Ross  Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
,,,,,,,"2281 Chandler  Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,"2316 Rachel  No way, forget it."
,,,,,,,"2317 Joey  C'mon, she's your mom!"
,,,,,,,"2318 Chandler  Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
,,,,,,,"2319 Rachel  Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"

,,,,,,,2338 Chandler  THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
,,,,,,,"2339 Jay Leno  Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?"
,,,,,,,"2340 Mrs. Bing  Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love..."
,,,,,,,2341 All  Awww!

,,,,,,,"2344 Mrs. Bing  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms."
,,,,,,,2345 Chandler  ...And then he burst into flames.
,,,,,,,"2346 Monica  Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2406 Joey  Ross, how could you let this happen?"
,,,,,,,"2407 Ross  I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's..."
,,,,,,,2408 Joey  You don't think my mom's sexy?
,,,,,,,2409 Ross  Well... not in the same way...
,,,,,,,"2410 Joey  I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2422 Joey  So are you gonna tell him?
,,,,,,,2423 Ross  Why would I tell him?
,,,,,,,"2424 Joey  How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."

,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2448 Chandler  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
,,,,,,,"2449 Ross  I wasn't- I mean, I-"
,,,,,,,"2450 Chandler  Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
,,,,,,,2451 Ross  I know-
,,,,,,,2452 Chandler  I can't believe you did this.
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2475 Phoebe  Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now?"
,,,,,,,2476 Rachel  Okay. I am so hot!
,,,,,,,"2477 Joey  Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
,,,,,,,2478 Ross  I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
,,,,,,,"2479 Joey  C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2487 Chandler  Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
,,,,,,,"2488 Ross  Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
,,,,,,,"2489 Chandler  Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
,,,,,,,2490 Ross  We're rehearsing a Greek play.
,,,,,,,2491 Chandler  That's very funny. We done now?
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2491 Chandler  That's very funny. We done now?
,,,,,,,"2492 Ross  No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
,,,,,,,"2493 Chandler  That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
,,,,,,,"2494 Ross  Okay, 'you' can't, or you can't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah!"
,,,,,,,"2495 Phoebe  Alright, whadyou do with him?"
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2535 Ross  Wow!
,,,,,,,"2536 Joey  Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"""
,,,,,,,"2537 Ross  'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
,,,,,,,2538 Joey  That makes more sense.
,,,,,,,"2539 Ross  So, what's going on now?"
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2554 Ross  Well, howdya feel?"
,,,,,,,2555 Chandler  Pretty good! I told her.
,,,,,,,"2556 Ross  Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we don't have to go down that road."
,,,,,,,"2557 Chandler  No-no-no-no, we're done."
,,,,,,,"2558 Monica  Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2570 Joey, Chandler, and Ross  Mma, Mma, Mmaah"
,,,,,,,"2571 Monica  So, did I hear Poconos?"
,,,,,,,"2572 Rachel  Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
,,,,,,,"2573 Phoebe  Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
,,,,,,,"2574 Monica  Yeah, that's a big step."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2840 Chandler  Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
,,,,,,,2841 Roger  It's textbook.
,,,,,,,"2842 Joey  Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
,,,,,,,"2843 All  Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!"
,,,,,,,"2844 Monica  Hey, how long are you in the city?"
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2861 Mr. Tribbiani  Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
,,,,,,,2862 Joey  You're one to talk.
,,,,,,,"2863 Mr. Tribbiani  Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
,,,,,,,2864 Joey  Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
,,,,,,,"2865 Mr. Tribbiani  Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,2864 Joey  Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
,,,,,,,"2865 Mr. Tribbiani  Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
,,,,,,,"2866 Joey  It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!"
,,,,,,,"2867 Rachel  I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
,,,,,,,2868 Chandler  What? What?
,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,"2946 Joey  I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
,,,,,,,"2947 Chandler  Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
,,,,,,,"2948 Joey  Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
,,,,,,,"2949 Chandler  Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
,,,,,,,2950 Joey  No.
