# Tae's group Combots 2021, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

This year we work on a "A Machine With Human-Like Memory Systems"

## Prerequisites

1. A unix or unix-like x86 machine
1. python 3.7 or higher. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended so that you don't mess up with the system python.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Data

The generated data is saved at `./data/`.

Take a look at the example jupyter notebook `./notebooks/how-to-data.ipynb`.
