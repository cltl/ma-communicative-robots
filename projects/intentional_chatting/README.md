# Project: Intentional chatting

## Overview

This repository contains the code base of the *Intentional chatting* project for the *Communicative Robots* Course at
the Vrije Universiteit (VU), Amsterdam.

In this repository, we represent dialogue as knowledge graphs and use these representations to create artificial
conversational agents that display specific intentions in their behaviour. For a detailed description of this project,
please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAyJhZL9LMWbPoVhh-0CUIGN1dSUXEOJFJI2RPdDU68/edit#). In
brief, the methods proposed include:

The implementations, and instructions of how to run them, can be found in their respective folders.

## Prerequisites

1. An x86 machine running Windows 10 or a Unix-based OS
1. Python 3.7 or higher. Running in a virtual environment (e.g., conda, virtualenv, etc.) is highly recommended.
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installation consiiderations

1. Remember that you have to manually clone and install the following libraries: `cltl-knowledgeextraction`
   , `cltl-knowledgelinking`, `cltl-knowledrepresentation`, `cltl-combot`
2. Download the classifier
   from [here](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1-33rHc9O2fM-PPaXu8I_oK5xnFwuMlN7&export=download&confirm=9iBg) and
